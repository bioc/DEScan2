\usage{
finalRegions(peakSamplesGRangesList, zThreshold = 20, minCarriers = 2,
  saveFlag = TRUE, outputName = "overlappedPeaks", verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{peakSamplesGRangesList}{GRangesList where each element is a sample
of called peaks. A z-score mcols values is needed for each GRanges.
(tipically returned by findPeaks function).}

\item{zThreshold}{a threshold for the z score.}

\item{minCarriers}{a threshold of minimum samples (carriers) for overlapped
regions.}

\item{saveFlag}{a flag for saving results in a bed file.}

\item{outputName}{the directory name to store the bed file.}
}
\value{
a GRanges of overlapping peaks selected with z-score,
n-peaks, k-carriers as mcols.
}
\description{
Align peaks to form common regions then filter regions for
presence in multiple replicates taking in input a GRangesList where each
element is a sample of called peaks.
